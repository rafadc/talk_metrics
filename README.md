# Notes from my talk on metrics and instrumentation

This is meant both as notes for the talk and as a (tiny playground)[src/01-basic_playground/] so you can play and learn a bit with it.

After watching the talk I recommend trying a bit the (playground)[src/01-basic_playground/] on your own thinking your own scenarios.

## Building the slides

```make``` with leave all the slides in the output directory
