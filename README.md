# Notes from my talk on metrics and instrumentation

The slides of the talk can be found [at Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16wnLPzS8Djit1RiSOlSF7y0aPBsDdLvWwleOMZXQsP8/edit?usp=sharing).

After watching the talk I recommend trying a bit the [playground](tree/master/src/basic_playground) on your own thinking your own scenarios.
